## Week 3 report
### What we have been working on
We have been learning about android/mobile development, since no one on our team has previous experience with it and we have decided
on using Xamarin (a Visual studio tool for ios/android/UWP development) we have been experimenting with making simple apps to get an
understanding of what is required for the UI and the backend to work. We also spent time designing the project.
### challenges
The main challenges we have run into have been with setting up Visual Studio and just not having experience with android development.
### Moving forward
This week and next week we will focus on getting the backend started (first getting a small POC done at the very least) with the
logic that we will need.
